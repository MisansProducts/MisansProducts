# About

Hello!

My name is Alex Akoopie. I have been programming and writing code as a hobby. I want to translate my skills to the real world. I have helped friends by writing code for them, but I wish to work with others in an environment where everyone writes code for a common goal.

I am currently uploading my projects to GitHub.

## Interesting Facts

I can make music and edit videos. I have also written poems and novels. Since I started programming, I have built desktop computers from their parts. More than anything else, I like to be consistent with everything.
